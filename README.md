# dart_vnc

A Flutter VNC client which implements the [RFB](https://github.com/rfbproto/rfbproto/blob/master/rfbproto.rst) protocol ([RFC 6143](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6143)).
Since the plugin is fully written in dart it should run on every device which can run Flutter apps.

**This project is under development. There is no guarantee that it works as intended or works at all.**

## Usage

To use this plugin, add dart_vnc as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.
The Plugin will be released on flutter pub when it is finished.
```yaml
dependencies:
  [...]
  dart_vnc: X.x.x
  [...]
```
## Example
Coming soon.
